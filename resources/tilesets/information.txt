.tsx files is filled with data from tiled folder, but .tpd file is a text file with names in format "folder/image" so instead of using folder to access the image, just find this path in greenlad.tpd each line contain all information for load a sprite.
format:
name1,texture,x,y,width,height,offset_x,offset_y

texture = texture atlas name (”greenland”)

name = original image name with path, but without extension (”cliffs/cliff2”) => fake folder structure

x = position on X, where the sprite starts on the texture

y = position on Y, where the sprite starts on the texture

width = width of the sprite in texture

height = height of the sprite in texture

offset_x = X offset position, relative to original top left - images are trimmed, so we need a original start

offset_y = Y offset position, relative to original top left - images are trimmed, so we need a original start
